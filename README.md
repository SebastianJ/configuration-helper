# Configuration::Helper

Configuration::Helper is just a collection of configuration helpers I tend to use for Rails app when setting up Redis, Memcached, Sidekiq etc.

It relies on the new Rails 5.2+ credentials feature where it expects to find the relevant connection details / settings.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'configuration-helper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install configuration-helper

## Usage

Your config/credentials.yml.enc file is expected to have a structure similar to the following:

```yaml
development:
  redis:
    servers:
      master:
        host: "localhost"
        port: "6379"
        pool_size: "55" # If Sidekiq is going to be used, this setting needs to be set higher than the concurrency setting in config/sidekiq.yml
        password: ""
        namespace: "app_namespace"
        sidekiq_database: "1"
        action_cable_database: "2"
      cache:
        host: "localhost"
        port: "6379" # Change to a different port if you have multiple instances set up (which you should have in production)
        pool_size: "55" # If Sidekiq is going to be used, this setting needs to be set higher than the concurrency setting in config/sidekiq.yml
        password: ""
        namespace: "app_namespace"
        cache_database: "3"
        session_database: "4"
  
  memcached:
    host: "localhost"
    port: "11211"
    pool_size: "55" # If Sidekiq is going to be used, this setting needs to be set higher than the concurrency setting in config/sidekiq.yml
    namespace: "app_namespace"
    session_key: "_app_session"
```

### Redis configuration
To configure Redis to be used for sessions + job storage for Sidekiq:

Create a new initializer, e.g. config/initializers/sidekiq.rb:

```ruby
::Configuration::Helper::Redis.configure_sidekiq
```

Create another initializer, e.g. config/initializers/session_store.rb:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.session_store :cache_store, key: Rails.application.credentials[:secret_key_base], expire_after: 14.days
```

The above depends on the cache store being configured in the relevant environments.

### Caching configuration
The caching setup needs to happen in config/environments/{environment}.rb since initializer settings are picked up after the cache store is set.

#### Redis

```ruby
config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, ::Configuration::Helper::Redis.generate_cache_configuration(driver: :hiredis).merge(compress: true)
```

#### Memcached

```ruby
Rails.application.config.cache_store = :dalli_store, ::Configuration::Helper::Memcached.config_variable(:host), ::Configuration::Helper::Memcached.generate_cache_configuration
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
